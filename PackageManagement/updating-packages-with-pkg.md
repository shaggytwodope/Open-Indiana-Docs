# Updating Packages with ```pkg```

```bash

adrian@openindiana-tuts:~$ sudo pkg update # you basically just wait, let pkg do it's thing.

adrian@openindiana-tuts:~$ # assuming everything went smoothly you'll have all your packages updated, 
adrian@openindiana-tuts:~$ # though you need to reboot into a new zfs system image.
adrian@openindiana-tuts:~$ # Usually named OpenIndiana-1 instead of OpenIndiana Hipster in the boot menu.
```
